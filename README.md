# Customer Classification and Prediction (Loan Data) on the basis of Cluster data


The basis of the project is to classify the customer data on the basis of cluster data that the bank can take on the basis of loan data. This will allow the institutional bank to customize services and products for the segment.

In this project, 4 supervised learning algorithms have been taken and are compared with each other to know which model is the best that can be taken by the bank.
